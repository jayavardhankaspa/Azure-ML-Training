## Defining and Differentiating Machine learning

**Machine Learning vs Traditional Programming**

The Definition:

>Machine learning is a data science technique used to extract patterns from data, allowing computers to identify related data, and forecast future outcomes, >behaviors, and trends.

  Data science deals with identifying patterns in data and using it to make predictions or map relations between data points; Machine learning is a technique used by data scientists to forecast future trends using existing data and outcomes implimenting various algorithms which learn and identify data patterns among the give data points.
