## Intro to Machine Learning

Machine learning in the perspective of:

* Computer science:
> We are using **input features** to create a **program** that can generate the **desired output**.

* Statistical:
>We are trying to find a **mathematical function** that, given the values of the **independent variables** can predict the values of the **dependent variables**.
